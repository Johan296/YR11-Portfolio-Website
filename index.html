<<<<<<< Updated upstream
<p2>I'm 15yrs old and I like to play badminton because there's nothing more satisfying than a perfect smash in badminton. 
After that i would Play online games like fornite, valorant, free fire, Overdox, etc or i'll just listen to music.
 My favorite artists are The Weeknd, Kendrick Lamar, SZA and Bruno Mars.</p2>
