        <p1 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">This is a turn-based battle adventure where players engage in quick, strategic fights between custom creatures inspired by Pokémon.
             Your goal is simple: either defeat your opponent by reducing their HP to zero or tactically flee to fight another day. Using basic keyboard controls, players choose to
              attack or escape while managing health and reacting to counterattacks. Designed with accessibility and originality in mind, the game blends nostalgia with simplicity ideal
               for fans of classic RPG mechanics who love fast-paced decision-making and light storytelling. The fun lives in your creature's stats, your chosen actions, and whether you're
                brave enough to fight or wise enough to run.</p1>

        <p1 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">I learned how to build a text-based game using Python. I used things like loops, choices, stats, and actions to make the game fun.
            I learned how to make a battle work using stamina, attacks, and healing. I also figured out how to give helpful instructions and use colors to make the game look cool.<br>
            <br>The trickiest part was making the battle work smoothly—especially when players press keys to choose actions. At first I used two types of input by accident, which caused some problems.
            Fixing that taught me how to control user input better. It also took some thinking to make recharge limits and special moves feel fair.<br>
            <br>I’ll make my code easier to manage by breaking it into smaller parts, like separate sections for choosing Pokétmons or battling. 
            This will help me fix things faster and keep it tidy. I also want to add a gym battle after the player catches their second Pokétmon.
             This will give the player a bigger challenge and make the game feel like it’s moving forward. 
             Later, I might add rewards like badges or healing items to make battles more exciting and to give the player a reason to keep playing.
